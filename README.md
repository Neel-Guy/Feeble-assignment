## Tech stack used:
- Vite + React
- Tailwind css
- navigation-menu from radix-ui following ShadCn documentation

## Assumptions
- Due to inability to find any animations in the design file, improvised and created a few animations and interactions
- For faster shipping and cleaner code, in smaller screens reversed the navbar order to avoid tweaking position properties of the pre-built navigation-menu component.
